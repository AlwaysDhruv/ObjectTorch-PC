About ObjectTorch
=========
Hi, it's Dhruv Sonavane so i am produced my project that's name is the ObjectTorch. ObjectTorch have developed for image classification using CNNs architecture that i give also architecture image for better understanding using also Tensorflow Framework. that can we train the model on any type of objects images dataset. so i have already give the pretrained model and images also. that model are trained on human, cat, dogs, flower, bike, horse.

The Exe FIle are on the working It will upload soon..

Thanks!!
